# WKU Cloud Engineering Lab

The Cloud Engineering Lab at Western Kentucky University (WKU), led by Dr. Michael Galloway, was active throughout the 2010s. Since COVID, research efforts led by Dr. Galloway have been related to the [WKU Extended Reality (XR) Lab](https://github.com/WKUXRLab) and [SunSketcher](https://science.nasa.gov/citizen-science/sunsketcher/).

This organization exists for access to the legacy software developed during the lab's active period.
